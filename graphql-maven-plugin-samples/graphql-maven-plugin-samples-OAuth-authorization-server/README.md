This project contains a standard implementation of an OAuth2 server, based on the _spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server_ project. It's basically a copy/paste of the JKW sample of the spring project.

It's used in integration tests, to check and demonstrate the use of OAuth authentication with both GraphQL clients and servers.
