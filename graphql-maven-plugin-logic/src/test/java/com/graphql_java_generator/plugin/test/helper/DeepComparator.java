 * <LI>Compares each field of a to each field of b (the fields defined in their superclasses are also scanned):</LI>
 * <LI>If the field is an id field, and a.id.equals(b.id), then a and b are considered as being the same. The comparison
 * will check that there other attributes are equals, and if not these differences are registered as differences of the
 * same object (with the key being the value of the id field, like the key in a Map). See
 * {@link #addIdField(Class, String)} for more information on this</LI>
 * <LI>If the field is an ignored field, this field is skipped</LI>
 * <LI>If the field is of a basic type: use the equals method. All enums should be registered in the basic type
 * list.</LI>
 * <LI>If the field is a List: do a deep non-ordered comparison. Each list must be of the same size, and each object in
 * a's field must be deep equal to one object of the b's list. To do this, for each item in a's list, a recursive
 * deepEquals call is done on each item of the b's list until this deepEquals call returns true. If no such call returns
 * true, then this item of the a's list is not present in the b's list: they are different</LI>
 * <LI>If the field is a known object type (see parameters): a recursive call to the deep comparison is done, to compare
 * the a's field to the b's field.</LI>
 * <LI>Otherwise an error is thrown (non managed type for comparison). This insure that the proper comparison mode is
 * used</LI>
 * </UL>
 * All differences are logged if the level is debug or lower. They are also returned by the
 * {@link #differences(Object, Object)} method, to allow further processing. This makes it possible to correct these
 * differences.
